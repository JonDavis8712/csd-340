            <p class="intro"><span class="sentence">Hello reader! My name is Jon Davis, yes the same name as the guy who fronts for the band Korn.</span> I currently live in Arkansas and am enlisted into the Airforce since 2019. I've been coding for a bit now, mostly on and off, but fell in love with it
                this past 2 years. My other passion is real estate investing, hoping that one day both things can be applied to one another in a way that benefits both loves</p>.
            <hr />
            <p>I have wife and two dogs, all of us like to stay as active as possible, and with two fur monsters jumping on you, its hard not to. I love working out at the base gym as my go to activity. Arkansas has plenty of out doorsy things to do!</p>
            <hr />
            <p>My hopes is to finish my degree, and get my real estate business running on full swing. My end goal is to set myself up to leave the military. A fun fact about me, is that my parents finally retired for
                the most part, and bought a house 2 doors down from me. Christmas and holidays are pretty easy now.
